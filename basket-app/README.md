### Learning Outcomes and Thought process

- I have already implemented this task, while I was learning react few months back, hence it was a brush for me, this was the most complex task out of all.
- useReducer is always a very confusing topic, but this project include the usage of this hook, I was able to understanf useReducer at a practical level.
- React portals never came in handy in any of my recent projects, hence it was good learning opporunity.
- Dues to time limit, I was not able to use useContextAPI for passing all the props, This can be a **further improvement point** for this project.
- I used module.css files, for having style sheet in coordination to the Component files.

### Approach

- Components are divided into Cart, Grossries, Layout, UI, I will start with basic.
- UI Component contains basic UI elements which are used in many places of the app.
- Layout Component contains the stick Header and cart component.
- Cart Component contains the Cart, to show the items put in cart by the user and present the total amount.
- Grossries, apart from static list of Grossries, main functionality of Grossries Components is to add the item in cart and increment the amount (X) of same Item.
