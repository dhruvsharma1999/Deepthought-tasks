# Deepthought Technical Assessment

## Notes to Recruiters

> Being an aspiring Front-end engineer, I focus both on the funcationality and asthetics i.e User Interface of the website, weather it's a small project or a big because I belive both are important for an excellent webapps.

> Also, I belive Documentation of your work is as important as the work, hence I am documenting all my projects to make it efficient and well structures, hence I request requiters to please reade all the ReadME file, to better understand my approach towards the projects.

### Learning Outcomes and Thought process

- This was a easy task in comparison to other, but still practiced few skiils
- Created Developer Giphy API to fetch the data.
- Given to simplicity of project, I did eveything in one file and imported that to App component.

### Approach

- A form input to collect the user input.
- On Enter or Submit key, passing the input to API call, which is called in useEffect.
- Fetch async await function to get search Endpoint, passing the user searched as the endpoint.
- Converting the data to JSON and rendering it to screen using map method.
