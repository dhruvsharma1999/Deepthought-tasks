# Deepthought Technical Assessment

## Notes to Recruiters

> Being an aspiring Front-end engineer, I focus both on the funcationality and asthetics i.e User Interface of the website, weather it's a small project or a big because I belive both are important for an excellent webapps.

> Also, I belive Documentation of your work is as important as the work, hence I am documenting all my projects to make it efficient and well structures, hence I request requiters to please reade all the ReadME file, to better understand my approach towards the projects.
