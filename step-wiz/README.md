### Learning Outcomes and Thought process

- This is the task, I did with my own approach with using react router.
- I did not use NPM wizard package because I wanted to implement it in router, as I was a good opportunity to brush up the react router skills.
- The only thing I was not able to acheive, because of time duration is form validation, this can be noted as **improvement point** for this project.
- I intend to add this functionality in upcoming days to this project.
- I brushed up some basic routing skills with the help of this project.

### Approach

- Very straight forward approach, the code is very messy, because I first tried to use many packages, but in the end decide to do it on my own.
- I have simple 5 form pages, 1 about page.
- The next button renders the next form component and previous renders the lst form component, the routing works in syncronous manner.
